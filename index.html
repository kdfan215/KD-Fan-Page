        </p>
        <p>He played one year of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns. He decided to wear the number 35 in honor
            of his
            former coach, Charles Craig. For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized
            as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award, the Naismith College Player

                alt="Picture of Kevin Durant">
            <p>After one year with the longhorns, Durant decided to declare for the 2007 NBA draft at 18 years old He
                was drafted by the Seattle
                Supersonics as the second overall pick. Durant was an instant star in the NBA and won Rookie of the Year
                with impressive statistics
                of 20.3 ppg, 4.4 rpg and 2.4 apg. He joined Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony as the only teenagers to
                average at least 20 points per game.
            </p>
            <p>After Durant's rookie year, the Seattle Supersonics reloacated and became the Oklahoma City Thunder.
                Durant's breakout year was 2010, his 3rd year in the NBA.
                He averaged a spectacular 30.1 ppg, becoming the youngest player in league history to win the Scoring
                Title. He would go on to win 2 more in a row. He could've
                won 4 in a row but he unselfishly decided to play more team ball, giving Carmelo Anthony of the New York
                Knicks the chance to steal the Scoring Title away from
                him in 2013. In 2012 Durant led his team to the NBA finals at only 23 years old. While he and his
                all-star teammate Russell Westbrook played phenominally in the
                finals, a combination of horrible officiating and unreliable play from teammates (James Harden) would
                keep Kevin from winning the 2012 NBA Championship. In 2013,
                Durant and the Thunder were primed for another deep playoff run. Patrick Beverly of the Houston Rockets
                had other plans. He decided to run into Russell Westbrook's
                knee after a time out was called. This tore Russell's meniscus rendering him injured for the rest of the
                year. While Durant was able to carry his team through the
                Rocket's series, he did not have enough manpower to beat the Memphis Grizzlies in the second round.
                Durant won his first league MVP award the following year averaging
                32 ppg, 8 rpg and 5 apg. Durant made it to the Western Conference finals against the San Antoinio Spurs.
                They were favored to win the series until Durant's all defensive
                teammate, Serge Ibaka got injured for 2 games. They lost those 2 games but won the next two with Ibaka
                back, who was not at full strength. They would lose games 5 and 6
                ending Durant's season. The following year was a tough one for Durant. He broke his foot about halfway
                through the 2014-2015 season and was out for six months. The following
                year Durant neary led his team to the 2016 Finals. He had a 3 games to 1 game advantage in the Western
                Conference Finals against the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors would
                come back to win the next 3 games and advance to the finals. Ultimately the Warriors would blow a 3-1
                lead in the finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
            </p>
            <p> After the 2016 season, Durant announced he would join the Golden State Warriors. Many looked upon this
                as an unfavorable move because Golden State had the greatest regular
                season record in NBA history the previous year. Durant faced a lot of ridicule and criticism from
                analysts and players alike. That did not stop him from continuing his amazing
                career. Durant led the Warriors to the 2017 NBA Championship and was named Finals MVP upon winning the
                title. He would go on to repeat this in 2018. The Warriors were expected
                to threepeat in 2019, but Durant was injured in the second round of the playoffs after dominating
                against the Clippers in the first round. He would not play until game 5 of the
                NBA Finals. With the Warriors down 3-1 against the Raptors, Durant's return would offer hope of a
                possible comeback to win the Championship. In game 5 Durant was terrific in the
                first quarter but tore his achilles early in the second quarter. The Toronto fans inexlicably cheered
                when Durant got injured, prompting looks of disgust from both Golden State
                and Toronto players. Toronto point guard Kyle Lowry was so appalled he even signaled his fans to be
                quiet by shushing them. The fans eventually did. But it was too late. They are
                considered some of the most classless NBA fans. Thanks in part to Durant's 11 points, the Warriors would
                win this game by 1 point. Without Durant, the Warriors would go on to lose
                game 6, making the Toronto Raptors the new NBA champs. In July 2019, Durant announced he would be
                joining the Brooklyn Nets on a 4 year contract. Though he will most likely injured
                his entire first year, many medical specialists believe he will come back and be as good as ever. If
                anyone can it is him. </p>
